### Project Title - Javamon, A Text Based Action Game

### Project synopsis

In this game, players start off by selecting their primary character from a roster of unique and diverse characters. Each character has its own set of abilities, stats, and personality, which can affect the gameplay and story.

The game is divided into a series of battles, each of which takes place in different locations and against different enemies. After winning each battle, the player gets to pick a new item and a new character to add to their team. The maximum number of characters a player can use is three, so players must carefully choose which characters to use based on their strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. New items include power ups such as armour, new attacks and potions.

Once the player has won three battles, they face off against a powerful boss enemy, who is more challenging than the regular enemies and requires careful planning and strategy to defeat. If the player wins the boss battle, they complete the game and can start again with a new character and higher difficulty level.

Overall, this turn-based battle game provides players with a challenging and engaging gameplay experience, with diverse characters, randomized battles, and various difficulty modes to keep players coming back for more.
